 ## Model
SQLCoder is a 15B parameter model that is fine-tuned on a base StarCoder model. It slightly outperforms gpt-3.5-turbo for natural language to SQL generation tasks on the sql-eval framework, and outperforms popular open-source models. It also significantly outperforms text-davinci-003, a model thatâ€™s more than 10 times its size.
